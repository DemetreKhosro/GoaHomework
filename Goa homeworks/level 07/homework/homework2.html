        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>For much of the 11th century, the <i>nascent Georgian kingdom</i> experienced geopolitical and internal difficulties, with various noble factions opposed to the centralization of the Georgian state. They were often backed by the <i><u>Byzantine Empire</u></i>>, which feared a dominion of the <u>Caucasus region</u> by the <u>Bagrationi dynasty</u>>, and in some instances fueled internal conflict through aristocratic families seeking more power. However, ties between Byzantium and Georgia were normalized when the two countries faced a new common enemy, the rising <u>Seljuk Empire</u> in the 1060s. Following the decisive Byzantine defeat at the Battle of <u><i>Manzikert</i></u> in 1071, Constantinople started to retreat from eastern Anatolia and entrusted Georgia with its administration, placing Georgia at the forefront of Turkish in the 1080s.</p><br>

            <p>The Kingdom of Georgia reached its zenith in the 12th to early 13th centuries. This period during the reigns of David IV (r. 1089-1125) and his great-granddaughter Tamar (r. 1184-1213) has been widely termed as the Georgian Golden Age.[60] This early <u>Georgian renaissance</u>, which preceded its Western European analog, was characterized by impressive military victories, territorial expansion, and a cultural renaissance in architecture, literature, philosophy and the sciences.[61] The Golden Age of Georgia left a legacy of great cathedrals, romantic poetry and literature, and the epic poem The Knight in the Tiger's Skin, considered a national epic.</p><br>
            
            <p>David IV suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized power in his hands to effectively deal with foreign threats. In 1121, he decisively defeated much larger Turkish armies during the Battle of Didgori and abolished the Emirate of Tbilisi.[64]</p>
