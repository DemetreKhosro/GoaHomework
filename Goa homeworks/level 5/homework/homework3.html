        <p>Hello! My name is Demetre Khosroshvili and i live in Georgia, Tbilisi. I am 13 years old and go to 118th public school.</p>
        <p>I have a few hobbies like programming, gaming and football</p><br>
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>I'm currently going through programming courses at the best programming academy in the world, GOA(short for Goal-Oriented Academy).</p>
        <p>I am learning Python and HTML. They are both very fun and interesting to learn.</p><br>
        The teaching process is very fun and educating.After joining GOA, i decide that in the future i want to be a programmer myself.
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p>I like to play some games in my free time. I usually play shooters or strategic based games, like Hell Let Loose, also some games just for fun like Roblox</p><br>
        and Forza Horizon 5 because i like cars.
        <h4>Football</h4>
        <p>I have been a fan of football for 3-4 years. I am a footballer myself and i play for FC Avchala. My favorite international team is of course Georgia and</p><br>
        my favorite club is Real Madrid. My team is currenly training for a championship we are about to enter and i have high hopes for winning because our last<br>
