        <p>Hello my name is Demetre Khosroshvili. I am 14 years old from Georgia, Tbilisi and go to the 118th public school.</p>
        <p>I am learning Web-development and leadership in Goal-Oriented Academy (GOA). I like it very much and i want to fully learn programming.</p>
        <p>I have only worked on 1 group project wich was a multi-page website about healthy life. It was very fun and i got some experience of working with others.</p>
        <p>Im also a big fan on football and play for FC Avchala. I always watch football games and check on my teams to see how theyre doing.</p>
        <p>I also like videogames very much. I have been a fan of videogames since i was a kid. I mostly like Open-world, FPS, Racing or Story games.</p>
