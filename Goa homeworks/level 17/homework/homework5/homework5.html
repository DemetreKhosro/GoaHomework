    <h1 id="top">My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hello my name is Demetre Khosroshvili. I am 14 years old, live in Georgia, Tbilisi and learn at the 118th public school.</p>
    <p>I have a lot of hobbies like playing football, videogames and programming, in this portfolio i will tell you about each of them.</p>
    <h2 id="ftbl">Playing football</h2>
    <p>I have like football for about 2-3 years. At first, i didnt like it, then when i started to understand it i only played with the kids in the streets, but after i wanted to join a team. My first team didnt even have a name, can you imagine?😂</p>
    <p>The coach was bad and i was training with kids that were 6-9 years old... I left and joined FC Elite because my friends invited me. I liked the team and the kids. We later change our name to GF(Georgian Football) but shortly after we got a new coach
        and everything changed. We got new kits, new training equipment, changed our name to FC Avchala, and the best of all, we started winning our matches.</p>
        <p>This is me at practice:</p>

    <h2 id="games">Video games</h2>
    <p>I have played video games since i was a kid. I played every genre of games on every type of platform. My favourites were especially action shooters like Call of Duty, racing like Forza Horizon 5 and a loooot more.</p>
    <p>I dont think i will have time to play games as much as before i started programming, but i think learning programming is better than playing video games.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3 id="goa">Programming</h3>
    <p>It all started when my grandma signed me up at <u>GOA(Goal-Oriented Academy)</u> to learn programming. She didnt even tell me but i approved her decision and started learning. Im currently learning Python and Web-development.</p>
    <p>By the end of the course i will know: Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If i want i can continue to learn deeper with the 2.5 year course that GOA offers after you finish the 10 month course.</p>
    <p><strong>GOA</strong> is the academy of chads and virgins are not allowed. The mentors and group leaders are amazing and can help you with anything.</p>
